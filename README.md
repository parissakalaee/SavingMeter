## General Information
- I designed this project to help people track the value of saved money (i.e. in bank account) vs. the highly variable inflation rate in Iran.


## Features
List the ready features:
- Calculate the amount of saving money based on variable Bank interest, Iran Inflation rate and the favorite goal time.
- Handy and Simple to use UI based on Google Material Design. 

I recently decided to practice writing code in Kotlin (after Udacity Android Kotlin Developer course), so I want to upgrade this project code, step by step to Kotlin.
### TO-DO:
- 


## Project Status
-Project is: _in progress_

## Acknowledgements
- Many thanks to my old team-mate Saber Nourizadeh to help me with the idea and testing.
