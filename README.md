This is simply one of my old Android projects in Java (the first one :-)), which published now as open-source.

## General Information
- I designed this project to help people track the value of saved money (i.e. in bank account) vs. the highly variable inflation rate in Iran.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement
I recently decided to improve my knowledge about Kotlin (after Udacity Android Kotlin Developer course), so I want to upgrade this project code, step by step to Kotlin.


## Acknowledgements
- Many thanks to my old team-mate Saber Nourizadeh to help me with the idea and testing.
